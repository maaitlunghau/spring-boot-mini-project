# Keeping /resume Project State in Sync

`.claude/skills/resume/PROJECT_STATE.md` is the persisted context the `/resume` skill loads so Claude doesn't have to re-analyze this repo from scratch each session.

After doing any of the following in this repo, update the relevant section of that file directly — don't wait to be asked:

- Shipping or reverting a fix in the auth/user module (login/register/refresh/logout, role management, CSRF, rate limiting)
- Resolving, or newly discovering, an item in `docs/known-issues.md`
- A decision the next session shouldn't silently reverse (e.g. Swagger staying public, CD staying a placeholder)
- Anything that would make a future `/resume` hand out stale advice

Update the `Last synced commit` line at the top of `PROJECT_STATE.md` to the current `git rev-parse HEAD` each time you touch it. Keep edits surgical — patch the specific section that changed, don't regenerate the whole file.
